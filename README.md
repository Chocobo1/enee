# Ensure Newline at EOF for EmEditor

## Preface

The original script was taken from the [forum](https://web.archive.org/web/20250315135710/https://www.emeditor.com/forums/topic/new-line-at-eof-on-save/#post-18716) and I added comments and tweaked the script a bit.


## Installation

1. Create a new folder `Macros` in EmEditor installation folder (`C:\Program Files\EmEditor\Macros`)
2. [Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chocobo1/enee/refs/heads/main/newlineAtEOF.jsee) the macro file and put it into the folder
3. In EmEditor, select menu `Macros` -> `Customize...`
4. Select `New` and choose the macro file
5. Select the macro and select `Runs at Events`
6. Select `Events...` and then select `Before Saving`
7. All done!
